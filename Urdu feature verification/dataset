Urdu Speech Emotion Dataset
This dataset is sourced from the URDU-Dataset, which contains speech recordings in the Urdu language labeled with different emotions. The original dataset consists of multiple audio samples representing various emotions.

Data Selection
For my experiment, I have used only 175 files from this dataset. The selection was based on the requirement of my speech emotion recognition model, ensuring that the chosen samples align with the emotions my model was trained on. Additionally, since the dataset originally includes the fear emotion, which is not present in my training data, I have excluded those samples to maintain consistency in classification.

Purpose
The selected audio files were processed to extract features such as Zero Crossing Rate (ZCR), Root Mean Square Energy (RMSE), MFCCs, and Mel Spectrograms, formatted in the same structure as the training data. These features were then used to evaluate my pre-trained speech emotion recognition modelâ€™s ability to generalize to Urdu speech data.
